	<p>This organization is a stock exchanges apply strict rules, listing obligations, and related regulations that are binding on all listed and trading parties. They are an organized and regulated financial market where securities are purchased and sold at prices governed by the forces of demand and supply so my proposal to this organization is mesh topology where by this type of topology is a network configuration in which each computer and network device is connected to the others.As we are in development country we have to expand our organizations and having wide connection that can help to exchange of good not only in Rwanda but also outside of it.
    This organization we need to use WAN (wide area network) because it is wide and useful where it help you to expand to have stock exchange in business and government agencies utilize wide area network to send data to members of organization to the clients and suppliers in different parts of the world.
</p>

<script type="text/javascript" >

	var name="Employee";
	var age= 45;
	document.write(name+   "and his is"+age+ "years old!");
